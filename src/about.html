                <h2>About this website</h2>
                <p>This website exists in two pieces: the website, which you're on right now, and the back-end that communicates with <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv">the Twitch.tv API</a> to report the channel's online status.</p>
                <p>It serves one simple purpose: extra accessibility to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cohhcarnage">Cohh's Twitch.tv channel's</a> online status, and a live viewer if it's online. An alternative name for this website is <a href="https://www.iscohhonline.com">iscohhonline.com</a>.</p>

                <h3>But why not just visit Twitch.tv directly?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>This website is available <a href="https://github.com/sebastienvercammen/iscohhlive">on GitHub</a>, to serve as a learning tool for web platform basics. It includes <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html">SCSS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">autoprefixer</a> JS, <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-left-gulp-and-grunt-for-npm-scripts-3d6853dd22b8">npm scripts</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout">CSS Grid</a> and other modern tools that can get you started with web development.</li>
                    <li>The value of a network isn't just the number of people in it <i>(n)</i>, it's proportional to the number of connected users <i>(nÂ²)</i>. Although this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metcalfe's law</a> which is originally applied to telecommunications networks, the same results can be seen in any network/community of people. The more accessible something is, and the more people get involved, the more the network grows! This is also the basis for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking">growth hacking</a>.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/sebastienvercammen/iscohhlive">open source code of this website</a> can be used as a basis for any enthusiastic or ambitious Twitch.tv streamer. Whether you just use it or build on it, it can help to improve your Twitch.tv channel.</li>
                    <li>I love building things! ðŸ˜Š</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Does Cohh know about and approve of this?</h3>
                <p>As of now: I don't know!</p>
                <p>I've sent a message to CohhCarnage and private messages to a handful of moderators, as well as provided an e-mail address in the footer of this website to <a href="mailto:hello@iscohh.live">get in touch</a>, hoping to get an official reply. I'm also open to giving all source code and domain names to Cohh, all he has to do is ask and I'll set it up.</p>
                <p>If you know anyone who can get in touch with him, please let him know!</p>

                <h3>Got any feedback?</h3>
                <p>Get in touch with me <a href="mailto:hello@iscohh.live">via e-mail</a>, send it my way and I'll take a look at all of your ideas. If it's a good one and realistic, I'll look at adding it.
